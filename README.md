Introduction: A function that generates a disguise signature of a stranger without the message

Accomplished project: 

                      1. A fake signature of Satoshi     //GenerateSignature()
However, I didn't managed to find any Satoshi's signature on the website, so I used a random signature which might come from an unknown stranger.
Instead of faking Satoshi's signature, in fact, this function generate a disguise signature of this stranger.

To run above codes, you'll need WinNTL-11_5_1 functions.

Be aware of "//" sign to run all functions.

Functions are defined in header file escda.h.

All codes are wrtien by myself.
